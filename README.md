# Martha TTS / Greenlandic Text-to-Speech
The `docker/` folder documents a container for the Martha TTS Web Service that'll allow anyone to run the Greenlandic text-to-speech service.

Oqaasileriffik does not currently run a public-facing TTS service for use by 3rd party app developers. So until we have that up and running, we provide anyone and everyone with the means to run one themselves.
